# Nancy Logo Guidelines

## OVERVIEW

This document defines the basic guidelines on how Nancy logo should be presented. That is, given a certain context, this document outlines which of the different logo variants should be used.

The purpose of this is to guide the end user of the logos through their usage, to obtain the best looks out of them, and as well to ensure and preserve Nancy's image and aesthetics.

Nancy's logo was designed with these goals in mind: 

- Simple and elegant
- Strong personality with a feminine touch
- Inspired on 1930s art deco ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco))
- Should contain both text and a self identifying  emblem (logotype + logo)
- Should vary in style depending on the context (see below)
- Should scale well up and down

Following those lines, Nancy's logo design is made of a silhouette portraying a woman's profile against a negative space, plus a sleek, capitalized, sharp cornered font type to balance the curves from the silhouette. Combined, they inspire simplicity, sophistication, elegance and harmony.

## VARIANTS

The logo may be presented in any of these variants:

## COLOR

Note that no color has been used for it. That is intentional. By default, the logo variants have no color in them. In addition to the variants shown above, each of them may be used inverted (e.g.: black over white can become white over black and vice versa).


If the use of colors is required given a certain graphical need, you should ask advice to Nancy's team before doing so.
