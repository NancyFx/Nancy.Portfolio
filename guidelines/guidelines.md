# Nancy Logo Guidelines

## OVERVIEW

This document defines the basic guidelines on how Nancy logo should be presented. That is, given a certain context, this document outlines which of the different logo variants should be used.

The purpose of this is to guide the end user of the logos through their usage, to obtain the best looks out of them, and as well to ensure and preserve Nancy's image and aesthetics.

Nancy's logo was designed with these goals in mind: 

- Simple and elegant
- Strong personality with a feminine touch
- Inspired on 1930s art deco ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco))
- Should contain both text and a self identifying  emblem (logotype + logo)
- Should vary in style depending on the context (see below)
- Should scale well up and down

Following those lines, Nancy's logo design is made of a silhouette portraying a woman's profile against a negative space, plus a sleek, capitalized, sharp cornered font type to balance the curves from the silhouette. Combined, they inspire simplicity, sophistication, elegance and harmony.

## VARIANTS

The logo may be presented in any of these variants:

__Silhouette only:__

## COLOR

Note that no color has been used. That is intentional. By default, the logo variants have no color in them. In addition to the variants shown above, each of them may be used inverted (e.g.: black over white can become white over black and vice versa).

If the use of colors is required given a certain graphical need, you should ask advice to Nancy's team before doing so.

## SPACING

Logos need a breathing space to live, especially when they are nearby other logos.

An 'X' height is defined for each of our logos. It is required at minimum 1/2 of this X-height around any of the logos, but it is recommend very strongly that you maintain a full X-height of space around the logo and advise using a minimum X-height margin around the logo only in extreme cases (for example, a design for a very small object like a pen.)

As a guidance, all .ai logo variants in our logo repository come with measurements for this purpose.

Below is an example of these measurements and the clear space used:

## SIZING

There is no restriction on how big any of the logos can be (as long as its size is justified by the context in which is used).

For smaller sizes there is a limit of 24 pixels tall for the sihlouette, and the text (as well as any bounding boxes) should be limited in size accordingly.

Below is an example of allowed and not allowed small sizes:

## DONTS // TODO: Add images...

- Never use the logo on similarly-colored backgrounds

- Never rearrange elements of the logo

- Never stretch, distort or rotate the logo

- Do not attempt to redraw the logos or otherwise recreate them. This could result in unauthorized logo variations getting spread around, and although intentions may be good, this could lead to Nancy's image corruption. Besides, you can easily get the logos from our public repository with no effort whatsoever, so why waste time!
